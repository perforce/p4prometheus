# sdp_instance: SDP instance - typically integer, but can be
# See: https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-sdp for more
# If this value is blank then it is assumed to be a non-SDP instance.
sdp_instance:   1

# ----------------------
# server_id: Optional - serverid for metrics - typically read from /p4/<sdp_instance>/root/server.id for 
# SDP installations - please specify a value if non-SDP install, or set server_id_path
server_id:

# output_cmds_by_user: true/false - Whether to output metrics p4_cmd_user_counter/p4_cmd_user_cumulative_seconds
# Normally this should be set to true as the metrics are useful.
# If you have a p4d instance with thousands of users you may find the number
# of metrics labels is too great (one per distinct user), so set this to false.

# ----------------------
# case_sensitive_server: true/false - if output_cmds_by_user=true then if this value is set to false
# all userids will be written in lowercase - otherwise as they occur in the log file
# If not present, this value will default to true on Windows and false otherwise.

# ----------------------
# output_cmds_by_ip: true/false - Whether to output metrics p4_cmd_ip_counter/p4_cmd_ip_cumulative_seconds
# Like output_cmds_by_user this can be an issue for larger sites so defaults to false.

# ----------------------
# output_cmds_by_user_regex: Specifies a Go regex for users for whom to output
# metrics p4_cmd_user_detail_counter (tracks cmd counts per user/per cmd) and
# p4_cmd_user_detail_cumulative_seconds
# 
# This can be set to values such as: "" (no users), ".*" (all users), or "swarm|jenkins"
# for just those 2 users. The latter is likely to be appropriate in many sites (keep an eye
# on automation users only, without generating thousands of labels for all users)
