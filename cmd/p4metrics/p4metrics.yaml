# p4metrics.yaml - Configuration file for p4metrics
# This file is normally written by the script install_p4prom.sh on Linux.
# Can be set manually if required

# ----------------------
# metrics_root: REQUIRED! Directory into which to write metrics files for processing by node_exporter.
# Ensure that node_exporter user has read access to this folder (and any parent directories)!
# For Windows users, this should be a path like C:/p4/metrics
metrics_root: /p4/metrics

# ----------------------
# sdp_instance: SDP instance - typically integer, but can be alphanumeric
# See: https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-sdp for more
# If this value is blank then it is assumed to be a non-SDP instance, and you will want
# to set other values with a prefix of p4 below.
sdp_instance:   1

# ----------------------
# p4port: The value of P4PORT to use
# IGNORED if sdp_instance is non-blank!
# Example values:
#   1666
#   ssl:myserver:1666
p4port:         

# ----------------------
# p4user: The value of P4USER to use
# IGNORED if sdp_instance is non-blank!
p4user:         

# ----------------------
# p4config: The value of a P4CONFIG to use
# This is very useful and should be set to an absolute path if you need values like P4TRUST/P4TICKETS etc
# IGNORED if sdp_instance is non-blank!
# Set to an absolute path to a file if you need it, e.g. /p4/config/p4config.txt
# Or on Windows: C:/p4/config/p4config.txt
p4config:      

# ----------------------
# p4bin: The absolute path to the p4 binary to be used - important if not available in your PATH
# E.g. /some/path/to/p4
# IGNORED if sdp_instance is non-blank! (Will use /p4/<instance>/bin/p4_<instance>)
# For Windows users, this should be the path to the p4.exe binary
p4bin:            p4

# ----------------------
# update_interval: how frequently metrics should be written - defaults to 1m
# Values are as parsed by Go, e.g. 1m or 30s etc.
update_interval:  1m

# ----------------------
# cmds_by_user: true/false - Whether to output metrics p4_monitor_by_user
# Normally this should be set to true as the metrics are useful.
# If you have a p4d instance with hundreds/thousands of users you may find the number
# of metrics labels is too great (one per distinct user), so set this to false.
# Or set it to false if any personal information concerns
cmds_by_user:     true

# ----------------------
# monitor_swarm: true/false - Whether to monitor status and version of swarm
# Normally this should be set to true - won't run if there is no Swarm property defined
monitor_swarm:    true

# ----------------------
# swarm_url: URL of the Swarm instance to monitor
# Normally this is blank, and p4metrics reads the p4 property value
# Sometimes (e.g. due to VPN setup) that value is not correct - so set this instead
# swarm_url: https://swarm.example.com
swarm_url:

# ----------------------
# swarm_secure: true/false - Whether to validate SSL for swarm
# Defaults to true, but if you have a self-signed certificate or similar set to false
swarm_secure:     true
